# HowTo verify MIP SDK access

## Create an Azure AD App Registration

Authentication against the Azure AD tenant requires creating a native application registration. The client ID created in this step is used in a later step to generate an OAuth2 token.

1. Go to https://portal.azure.com and log in as a global admin.
   > Your tenant may permit standard users to register applications. If you aren't a global admin, you can attempt these steps, but may need to work with a tenant administrator to have an application registered or be granted access to register applications.
2. Click Azure Active Directory, then **App Registrations** in the menu blade.
3. Click **View all applications**
4. Click **New Applications Registration**
5. For name, enter **MipSdk-Sample-Apps**
6. Set **Application Type** to **Native**
7. For Redirect URI, enter **mipsdk-auth-sample://authorize**
   > Note: This can be anything you'd like, but should be unique in the tenant.
8. Click **Create**

The **Registered app** blade should now be displayed.

1. Click **Settings**
2. Click **Required Permissions**
3. Click **Add**
4. Click **Select an API**
5. Select **Microsoft Rights Management Services** and click **Select**
6. Under **Select Permissions** select **Create and access protected content for users**
7. Click **Select** then **Done**
8. Click **Add**
9. Click **Select an API**
10. In the search box, type **Microsoft Information Protection Sync Service** then select the service and click **Select**
11. Under **Select Permissions** select **Read all unified policies a user has access to.**
12. Click **Select** then **Done**
13. In the **Required Permissions** blade, click **Grant Permissions** and confirm.
